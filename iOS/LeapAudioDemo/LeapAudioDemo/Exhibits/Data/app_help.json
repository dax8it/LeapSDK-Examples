  "content": "Welcome. You can explore the portfolio in two ways: guided or self-directed.\n\nFrom the Home screen, ask me about the artist, the exhibitions, or how to navigate.\n\nTap Enter Galleries to see the full list of collections. You can ask: \"What is Black Canvas about?\" or \"Which gallery should I start with?\"\n\nSelect a gallery to enter it. From there you can start an Auto Tour for a narrated walkthrough, or browse the images yourself.\n\nTap any artwork to open it, then press Ask about this work to hear the story, technique, and context behind that image.\n\nYou can return to the Home screen anytime using the Home button.\n\nIf you want, tell me what kind of mood you're in—gritty street, dreamy night, or clean rooftop editorial—and I'll recommend a gallery."
