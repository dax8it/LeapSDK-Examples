# Mobile iOS Design

## Overview
Use for navigation flow, layout decisions, and SwiftUI UX details.

## Agent Behavior Contract
1. Follow iOS HIG conventions for navigation, touch targets, and accessibility.
2. Preserve existing visual language unless a redesign is requested.
3. Prioritize clarity for voice interactions (transcript visibility, input affordances).
4. Avoid disruptive navigation resets; keep runtime state stable.

## Project Notes
- Multi-gallery flow: Home → Galleries → Exhibit → Artwork Detail.
- Transcript should be visible and update during streaming.
